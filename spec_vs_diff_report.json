  "summary": "The diff shows that Hero.tsx was modified to include the second CTA button with explicit white text classes (text-white hover:text-white) and border-2 border-white for visibility. This directly addresses REQ-22 by applying a high-contrast text color (white) to the second CTA button, ensuring legibility in default, hover, and focus states, while leaving the first button and other elements unaffected.",
