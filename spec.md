# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the text color of the second CTA button in the Hero section so its label is clearly visible.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the text color of the second CTA button in `Hero.tsx` to a high-contrast color (e.g., white or dark green) that is legible against its background
- Ensure the text remains visible in default, hover, and focus states

**User-visible outcome:** The second CTA button in the Hero section displays clearly readable label text on all screen sizes and interaction states.
